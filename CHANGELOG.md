## [Unreleased]


### Added

* `dynamic::Grid::new_from_iter`


## [0.1.3] - 2024-12-08

### Added

This release adds a `dynamic` module with a new `Grid` struct.

This is essentially a second attempt at designing the `Grid` API, with two main differences:

* The grid size can change after creation and `push_row` is the primary way to build a `dynamic::Grid`.
  I think this will improve the ergonomics of the API.
* The grid API doesn't depend on `Coord` and `Rect`, but take multiple integer arguments instead.
  This nullify the needs to add conversion from every possible vector type to `Coord`.
  And I think it might even make the API more ergonomics and simpler to understand.


## [0.1.2] - 2024-12-07

### Added 

* `aline` feature for compatiblity with the [`aline`](https://github.com/jcornaz/aline) crate (version `1.x.x`)
  It effectively replaces the `aline-v01` feature flag

### Dependencies

* Lower MSRV to 1.60


## [0.1.1] - 2023-12-09

### Added 

* `Rect::coords` iterator
* `Grid::cells` iterator
* `Grid::get_mut` and `Grid::set` method to mutate the content

### Documentation

* Minor documentation improvements

## [0.1.0] - 2023-12-08

* `Grid` struct
  * Create a new grid either with default values for cells, an iterator of cells, or using an `init` function for each cell
  * Access a cell by coordinate
  * Iterate over cells that are in a given rectangle
* `Coord` struct
* `Rect` struct
* `no_std` support (by disabling the `std` feature)
* `aline-v01` feature for compatiblity with the [`aline`](https://github.com/jcornaz/aline) crate
